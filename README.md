A powerful mock server tool for creating and managing API mocks for testing. FTMocks provides a simple CLI to initialize mock projects and set up mock servers.

â”œâ”€â”€ defaultMocks/            # Directory for default mock files
â”œâ”€â”€ ftmocks.env              # Environment configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # This setup guide
```
